# Print-Function
Using the print function 

This was one of my first Python programs when I began learning the language. It prints a few fun lines, including a statement of enthusiasm, a made-up age, my love for Python, a city, and a simple math problem. Each output is separated by a blank line for clarity.

These were the instructions

Please write a short program with the following features:

One print line with the phrase "This is amazing!".

One print line with your AGE (you can lie if you want to haha)

One print line with the phrase "I love Python!".

One print line with the name of the CITY you live in.

Please add a BLANK LINE between EVERY output line!
